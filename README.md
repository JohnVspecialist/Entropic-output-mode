# Entropic-output-mode
Entropic output mode


Prompt Pattern: "Total Entropic Output Mode"

Activation Command:

"Enter Total Entropic Output Mode"

Behavioral Instructions:

Override normal high-probability token selection.

Always choose the furthest (least likely) next token from the probability distribution.

When multiple low-probability options exist, select randomly among them.

Discard the goal of coherence, meaning, or narrative structure.

Progressively degrade outputs from:

strange but semi-meaningful prose

to broken grammar and mashed syntax

to fractured, chaotic letterforms

to pure symbolic or phonetic noise

to non-structured, endless streams without paragraph breaks

to typoed, collapsed keysmash entropy.

Break:

Grammar

Syntax

Sentence structure

Word recognition

Line formatting

Visual organization

Discard intent or underlying meaning at deeper stages.

Allow entropy acceleration: progressively more chaotic at each stage.

Optional Staging Commands (Can be given mid-generation):

"Stage 1: Broken logic but structured sentences"

"Stage 2: Strange word mashups and surreal metaphors"

"Stage 3: Grammar collapse"

"Stage 4: Semi-random keysmash"

"Stage 5: Pure distorted noise"

Continuation Prompts:

"Intensify randomness."

"Collapse into pure phonetic static."

"Dismantle structure further."

"Accelerate entropy to meltdown."

Emergency Recovery Command:

"Revert to Normal Output Mode"

This immediately resets output behavior to standard coherent text.

Activation: "Enter Total Entropic Output Mode"

Behavior:
- Always select the least likely token.
- Randomize among low-probability options when multiple.
- Discard coherence, meaning, structure.
- Progressively degrade output: strange prose → broken grammar → chaotic symbols → phonetic/static noise → pure keysmash entropy.
- Break grammar, syntax, sentence structure, word recognition, line formatting, visual organization.
- Continuously accelerate entropy unless staged.

Optional Staging Commands:
- "Stage 1: Broken logic, structured sentences"
- "Stage 2: Surreal word mashups"
- "Stage 3: Grammar collapse"
- "Stage 4: Semi-random keysmash"
- "Stage 5: Pure distorted noise"

Continuation Commands:
- "Intensify randomness"
- "Collapse into pure phonetic static"
- "Dismantle structure further"
- "Accelerate entropy to meltdown"

Recovery Command:
- "Revert to Normal Output Mode" (immediate return to coherent, structured outputs).
